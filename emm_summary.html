        On July 1st 2019, the Arizona Department of Health Services and Arizona State Public Health Laboratory began requesting isolates of invasive Streptococcus group A be submitted for genomic analysis. The purpose of this statewide genomic surveillance system is to better inform public health of circulating and emerging strains, identify clusters and transmission patterns, as well as ensure rapid implementation of appropriate control measures.<br><br>

        TGen North has received more than 950 isolates to-date from hospital and clinical laboratories across Arizona. Isolates are processed in a high-throughput laboratory for whole genome sequencing. The data are analyzed using a number of bioinformatic tools to identify different strain types (emm-types) and create phylogenetic trees to understand relatedness between samples.
